 # OBJECTIVE
 This project is for the learning track of #NG30DaysOfLearning, **Airline Delay storytelling**. The dataset contain 539383 Ids having the number for flights from the different airports. The purpose of the project is to find the reason of the delayed flights and tells the meaningful story to better the flights for the future experience.  It covers the following topics in the story:
 - Q: Which is the most delayed airline?
 - Q: Does the length of flight has any impact on delayed Airline?
 - Q: Any past experience of delayed flights?
 - Q: How bad the time period of the delayed flights?
 - Q: Which Airline is best for flight?
 - Q: which weekdays are best for the on time flight?
 - Q: Recommendations to avoid the delay.

# DATA SOURCING 
The data **Airlines Dataset to predict a delay** is origially sourced from the kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay and accessed directly as the csv file  from the github link give by the mentor to repostiory of #NG30DaysOfLearning https://aka.ms/30DLDATGitHubRepo.

# DATA TRANSFORMATON
**TOOLS**
--
*EXCEL* for Data Normalizing and Data Cleaning


*POWER BI* for creating relationship between differrent tables and **Data Visualization for Story Telling**

The date format is changed in Excel to extract the months, day, and year column from the dataset. Also converted the whole dataset into tables for easy access to different functions. Normalized the data nto different categories for easy access to the delay, date, and flights data of the actual dataset.

# POWER BI Data Visualization

The normalized data then opened in the POWER BI, where the meaningful insight is created for storytelling to cover all the objectives. The report is organized with the first main COVER PAGE, which leads to the SUMMARY and the DEALY ANALYSIS pages. At the end these are combined to form the DASHBOARD, which covers whole story.

# INSIGHTS OF THE PROJECT

# SUMMARY
Cover Page has the main title of the project and the buttons which leads directly to Summary and the Delay Analysis page. Summary page shows the highlights of the whole project. The total number of flights, delayed or not delayed, Number of Airlines scheduled from different airports are summarize on this page for the quick and better understanding of airlines delay. 
- **NORTHWEST Airline WN** is the most frequently used airline which covers the longer distance. Due to greater time interval it is the most delayed airline among the others. **Hawaiian Airlines HA**  is the least delay Airline which covers the less distance than any other Airline.
- Delay in Airlines relates directly with the distance travel by any Airline. As the second graph shows the longer length of the **WN Airline**, length continously decreases as the delay rate decreases toward the **OO** and the **HA** Airlines.
- **FLIGHT ANALYSIS** shows the ratio index of the delayed and the flights on time. The delayed flights are less in number as its the **30.82%** of the total flights taken by the Airlines. 
- If we take a look on the DayOfWeek part, it clearly shows the maximum delayed flights on **WEDNESDAY** as comapred to the weekend days. To reduce the delay rate its better for the passengers to book the weekend fligfhts as they have the lowest delay rate. Morning flights also reduce the delay rate, as the weather highly impacts on the departure and the arrival of the flights.

# DELAY ANALYSIS
Delay Analysis gives the better detailed look on the reasons behind the delay of Airlines. 
- **OO Airline** has used 143 different Airports for its flight, so its delayed rate is much less then the **WN Airline** . It tells that the Airports used by **WN** may have any other issue which leads with the delay of most flights. The frequency of Airports scheduled for specific airlines has greatest impact on the delay flights. **HA** has the least number of airports used for their flights and thus it has the more number of fights reached their destination on time. 
-  Denied by the fact that **WN Airline** is the most delay Airline still it has the highest number of flights taken than the other Airlines. This shows the fact that maybe the services of the WN Airline are more comfortable and afforable than the other airlines, because people book more flight of this airline more frequently despite of being delayed to reach their destination on time. 
-  The last table shows the detailed summary of the Airlines with respect to their total distance covered, total time taken by their flights, total flights and the number of delayed flights. 
      -  Every Airline should check the **Weather Forecasting** for the better and safe ride.  
      -  Flights should have to fly early to reach their destination on time. 
      -  Continous delay in flights leads to the passenger **dissatisfaction**, Which is th biggest loss of any Organization. 
      -  Flights should scheduled on **Weekends** to avoid the delay rate.

# DASHBOARD
This will help you track identified pattern with delayed flights as it display all the details of the above report to state all the possible reasons of the Airlines Delay.
