# CAPSTONE PROJECT AIRLINE DELAY

#NG30DaysOfLearning Capstone Project
 ---- 
 
 # OBJECTIVE
 This project is for the learning track of #NG30DaysOfLearning, **Airline Delay storytelling**. The dataset contain 539383 Ids having the number for flights from the different airports. The purpose of the project is to find the reason of the delayed flights and tells the meaningful story to better the flights for the future experience.  It covers the following topics in the story:
 - Q: Which is the most delayed airline?
 - Q: Does the length of flight has any impact on delayed Airline?
 - Q: Any past experience of delayed flights?
 - Q: How bad the time period of the delayed flights?
 - Q: Which Airline is beat for flight?
 - Q: which weekdays are best for the on time flight?
 - Q: Recommendations to avoid the delay.

# DATA SOURCING 
The data **Airlines Dataset to predict a delay** is origially sourced from the kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay and accessed directly as the csv file  from the github link give by the mentor to repostiory of #NG30DaysOfLearning https://aka.ms/30DLDATGitHubRepo.

# DATA TRANSFORMATON
**TOOLS**
--
*EXCEL* for Data Normalizing and Data Cleaning


*POWER BI* for creating relationship between differrent tables and **Data Visualization for Story Telling**

The date format is changed in Excel to extract the months, day, and year column from the dataset. Also converted the whole dataset into tables for easy access to different functions. Normalized the data nto different categories for easy access to the delay, date, and flights data of the actual dataset.

# POWER BI Data Visualization

The normalized data then opened in the POWER BI, where the meaningful insight is created for storytelling to cover all the objectives. The report is organized with the first main COVER PAGE, which leads to the SUMMARY and the DEALY ANALYSIS pages. At the end these are combined to form the DASHBOARD, which covers whole story.
