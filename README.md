# DATA TRANSFORMATON
**TOOLS**
--
*EXCEL* for Data Normalizing and Data Cleaning


*POWER BI* for creating relationship between differrent tables and **Data Visualization for Story Telling**

The date format is changed in Excel to extract the months, day, and year column from the dataset. Also converted the whole dataset into tables for easy access to different functions. Normalized the data nto different categories for easy access to the delay, date, and flights data of the actual dataset.

# POWER BI Data Visualization

The normalized data then opened in the POWER BI, where the meaningful insight is created for storytelling to cover all the objectives.
